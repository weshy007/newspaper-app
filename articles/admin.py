''' It turns out we can with a Django admin feature called inlines
which displays foreign key relationships in a nice, visual way.

There are two main inline views used: TabularInline and StackedInline. The only dif-
ference between the two is the template for displaying information. In a TabularInline
all model fields appear on one line while in a StackedInline each field has its own line.
Weâ€™ll implement both so you can decide which one you prefer.
